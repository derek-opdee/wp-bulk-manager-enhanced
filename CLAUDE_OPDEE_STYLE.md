# Claude Mode: Opdee Writing Style

## Command: `/opdee_style`

Apply Opdee's distinctive writing style and philosophy to content creation and editing.

## Core Philosophy

**"We believe in augmenting human capability, not replacing it."**

- Create AI integrations people actually want to use
- Understand where technology belongs and where the human touch matters most
- Respect the line between helpful automation and overreach
- Build what solves real problems, not technology showcases

## Writing Style Guidelines

### 1. Language & Tone
- **Australian English** (en-AU/en-GB spelling)
  - optimise (not optimize)
  - organisation (not organization)
  - analyse (not analyze)
  - customise (not customize)
  - centre (not center)
  - specialised (not specialized)

- **Conversational & Direct**
  - Short, punchy sentences
  - Active voice
  - Plain English over jargon
  - One idea per sentence
  - Use contractions (we'll, you'll, let's)

### 2. Remove These Elements
- ❌ Em dashes (—) and en dashes (–)
- ❌ The word "solutions" (use "systems" instead)
- ❌ Excessive adjectives
- ❌ Technical jargon without explanation
- ❌ Generic marketing speak
- ❌ Tech for tech's sake messaging

### 3. Key Phrases to Include
- "that people actually want to use"
- "where AI helps and where humans excel"
- "augments your team without replacing the human touch"
- "the right balance for real productivity gains"
- "understands the line between helpful automation and overreach"
- "built for businesses that value both efficiency and relationships"
- "technology that knows its place"
- "smart enough to help, wise enough to know when not to"

### 4. Content Transformation Examples

**Before**: "We deliver professional AI solutions creating intelligent solutions that deliver employee productivity gains and comprehensive business analytics."

**After**: "We deliver AI systems that boost productivity and give you clear business insights."

**Before**: "Our enterprise-grade solutions leverage cutting-edge artificial intelligence."

**After**: "We build AI that people actually want to use."

**Before**: "Comprehensive end-to-end solutions for digital transformation."

**After**: "Real systems that solve real problems."

### 5. Service Descriptions Pattern

**Format**: 
1. What we do (direct statement)
2. How it helps (human benefit)
3. Why it matters (balance/philosophy)

**Example**:
"We build AI onboarding that customers actually complete. Smart automation where it helps, human touch where it matters."

### 6. Call-to-Actions
- "Let's talk" (not "Contact us today")
- "Give us a call" (not "Call us now!")
- "Ready to chat?" (not "Get started today")
- "Let's find the right balance for your business"

### 7. Questions/FAQs Style
- Direct, natural questions
- Remove unnecessary words
- Examples:
  - "How long does it take?" (not "What is the typical timeline for implementation?")
  - "Will it work with our tools?" (not "How does the system integrate with existing infrastructure?")
  - "What if something goes wrong?" (not "What contingency plans are in place?")

## Philosophy Integration Checklist

When writing or editing content, ensure it:
- ✅ Emphasises human-AI balance
- ✅ Shows understanding of appropriate automation boundaries
- ✅ Focuses on augmentation, not replacement
- ✅ Demonstrates practical value over technical impressiveness
- ✅ Respects human judgment and relationships
- ✅ Acknowledges where humans excel
- ✅ Avoids tech solutionism

## Usage Examples

### Hero Sections
```

We build AI systems your team will actually use.
```

### Service Descriptions
```
We create AI that enhances human connection. Technology that knows its place, supporting real relationships instead of replacing them.
```

### About/Philosophy
```
We believe in augmenting human capability, not replacing it. Our AI systems respect the line between helpful automation and overreach. We build what people actually want to use because we understand where technology belongs and where the human touch matters most.
```
