1. Add location mentions:
   ```
   Transform your business → Transform your [location] business
   for businesses → for [location] businesses
   Our team → Our [location]-based team
   ```

2. Add location-specific CTAs:
   ```
   Get a Quote → Get a [search_term] Quote in [location]
   Contact Us → Contact Our [location] [search_term] Experts
   ```

## Testing

After creating:
1. Save as draft first
2. Preview a few variations:
   - `/ai-development-melbourne/`
   - `/machine-learning-sydney/`
   - `/api-development-brisbane/`
3. Check that dynamic fields render correctly
4. Verify SEO titles and descriptions
5. Publish when satisfied

## Managing via Bulk Manager

Once created, use the CLI to:
```bash
./run_enhanced.sh
# Select option 10: Manage SEO Generator Page
# Enter the new page ID
# Add/edit terms and locations as needed
```

## Expected Output

- Each with unique URL
- Targeted SEO optimization
- Same professional design
- Dynamic content that reads naturally

## Notes

- The transformed content already has [search_term] replacements
- Add [location] replacements where it makes sense
- Keep terms relevant to AI/tech services
- Start with major cities, expand later
- Monitor performance in Search Console
