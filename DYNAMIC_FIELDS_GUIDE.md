# Dynamic Fields Guide for SEO Generator Pages

## Overview

Dynamic fields allow you to create one page template that generates hundreds of unique pages for different search terms and locations. This guide covers best practices for using dynamic fields effectively.

## Available Dynamic Fields

### SEO Generator (Square Brackets)
- `[search_term]` - Singular form of the search term
- `[search_terms]` - Plural/service form of the search term
- `[location]` - The location name

### Legacy Bulk Create (Curly Braces)
- `{service}` - Service name
- `{location}` - Location name
- `{service_plural}` - Plural form

## Grammar Rules and Best Practices

### 1. Singular vs Plural Usage

**[search_term] - Use for singular references:**
```
✅ Good:
- "Our [search_term] helps businesses grow"
- "Professional [search_term] in [location]"
- "Get expert [search_term] today"
- "[search_term]-powered solutions"

❌ Avoid:
- "Our [search_term]s help" (double plural)
- "We offer [search_term]" (when plural is needed)
```

**[search_terms] - Use for plural/service references:**
```
✅ Good:
- "We provide [search_terms] for all industries"
- "Our [search_terms] include..."
- "Professional [search_terms] in [location]"

❌ Avoid:
- "[search_terms]'s benefits" (possessive of plural)
- "A [search_terms]" (article with plural)
```

### 2. Handling Terms That Already Include "Services"

Many search terms already include "Services" (e.g., "AI Web Development Services"). Here's how to handle them:

```
Search term: "AI Web Development Services"

❌ Wrong:
- "AI Web Development Services services" 
- "Our AI Web Development Services's team"

✅ Correct:
- "AI Web Development Services solutions"
- "Our AI Web Development Services help..."
- "Expert AI Web Development Services provider"
```

**Recommended patterns:**
- Replace "services" with "solutions": `[search_term] solutions`
- Use as adjective: `[search_term] provider`
- Rephrase: `Our [search_term] help...`

### 3. Location Integration

**Optimal distribution:**
- Title/H1: Always include
- First paragraph: Mention within first 100 words
- Body: 3-5 natural mentions throughout
- CTAs: Include in calls-to-action
- Footer: Service area mention

**Natural location patterns:**
```
✅ Effective:
- "Serving [location] businesses since 2020"
- "Our [location] team of experts"
- "Trusted by [location] companies"
- "[location]'s premier [search_term] provider"
- "Local [location] [search_term] specialists"

❌ Avoid:
- "[location] [location] services" (repetition)
- "In [location] in [location]" (double preposition)
```

### 4. Avoiding Awkward Repetition

**Common mistakes:**
```
❌ "[search_term] & [search_term] services"
❌ "[search_term] [search_term] solutions"
❌ "We provide [search_term] providing..."

✅ Better alternatives:
- "[search_term] & Integration Services"
- "Comprehensive [search_term] solutions"
- "We deliver [search_term] that provides..."
```

### 5. Testing Your Content

Before finalizing, test your content with these term types:

**Single-word terms:**
- "AI Integration" → "Our AI Integration helps..."

**Multi-word terms:**
- "AI Web Development" → "Our AI Web Development helps..."

**Terms with "Services":**
- "AI Development Services" → "Our AI Development Services help..."

**Technical terms:**
- "AI API Integration" → "Our AI API Integration helps..."

3. **Local focus**: Make location mentions feel natural, not forced
4. **Variation**: Use synonyms like "solutions", "services", "systems" to avoid repetition
5. **Context**: Ensure dynamic fields make sense in context
6. **Professional tone**: Maintain quality regardless of term combination

Remember: The goal is to create pages that feel naturally written for each specific search term and location combination, not like a template with blanks filled in.
