## Executive Summary

The RenoWarriors website has significant SEO optimization opportunities. Every page on the site is missing custom SEO titles and meta descriptions, which are critical for search engine visibility. Additionally, there are widespread US spelling issues that need to be corrected for Australian audiences, and several pages lack proper H1 tag structure.

## Critical Issues (High Priority)

### 1. Missing SEO Titles (16 pages - 100% of site)
**Impact:** Without custom SEO titles, search engines display generic page titles that don't optimize for keywords or click-through rates.

**Affected Pages:**
- All 16 pages lack custom SEO titles
- Key service pages affected: Bathroom, Kitchen, Interior, and Full Home Renovation services
- High-traffic pages affected: Home, About, Contact

**Recommendations:**
- Implement unique SEO titles for each page (50-60 characters)
- Include primary keywords + location (e.g., "Bathroom Renovations Melbourne | Reno Warriors")
- Use action-oriented language for service pages

### 2. Missing Meta Descriptions (16 pages - 100% of site)
**Impact:** Without meta descriptions, Google generates snippets automatically, missing opportunities to control messaging and improve CTR.

**Affected Pages:** All 16 pages

**Recommendations:**
- Write compelling meta descriptions (120-160 characters)
- Include call-to-action and unique value proposition
- Incorporate location keywords naturally

### 3. H1 Tag Issues (5 pages - 31% of site)
**Impact:** H1 tags are crucial for SEO and user experience. Missing or improper H1s hurt rankings.

**Specific Issues:**
- No H1 tag: Book a consultation, Privacy Policy, Testimonials, Blog
- H1 too short: About page (only 8 characters)

**Recommendations:**
- Add descriptive H1 tags to all pages
- Ensure H1s include primary keywords
- Make H1s compelling and descriptive (20-70 characters)

## Medium Priority Issues

### 4. US Spelling Throughout Site (15 pages - 94% of site)
**Impact:** Using US spelling on an Australian site reduces local relevance and may impact local SEO.

**Common Issues Found:**
- "color" instead of "colour" (found on most pages)
- "center" instead of "centre" (found on most pages)
- "recognize" instead of "recognise" (Privacy Policy)

**Recommendations:**
- Global find/replace for all US spellings
- Update content management guidelines to ensure Australian spelling
- Review all new content before publishing

### 5. Missing Local SEO Keywords (4 pages - 25% of site)
**Impact:** Pages without location indicators miss local search opportunities.

**Affected Pages:**
- Thank you page
- Privacy Policy
- Testimonials
- Blog

**Recommendations:**
- Add location context where appropriate
- Include "Melbourne" or "Australia" in relevant content
- Consider creating location-specific landing pages
