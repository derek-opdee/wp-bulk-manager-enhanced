Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

General Service Questions
Q: Why should we add a newsletter to our marketing strategy?
A: Newsletters provide a direct communication channel with your
audience, offering higher engagement rates than social media, improved
brand loyalty, and measurable ROI. They allow for consistent
touchpoints with customers and prospects while providing valuable data
insights.
Q: How often will my newsletter be sent?
A: Our service provides one high-quality newsletter per month. This
frequency balances consistent communication with your audience while
maintaining premium content quality and preventing subscriber fatigue.
Q: Who writes the content for our newsletter?
A: Opdee's professional content team creates your newsletter based on
your preferences and guidelines. You can also submit specific content for
inclusion, which our team will review and format accordingly.
Q: What if we miss a content submission deadline?
A: If you miss the content submission deadline (5th of each month), our
team will create curated, industry-relevant content to ensure timely
newsletter distribution, maintaining consistency for your subscribers.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Design & Content
Q: Can we change our newsletter design after approval?
A: The approved template serves as your standardised design for
consistency and brand recognition. Minor content adjustments are
permitted monthly, but significant template changes would require a
new design contract.
Q: What types of content work best in newsletters?
A: Effective newsletter content includes industry insights, company
updates, educational resources, promotional offers, curated industry
news, and blog highlights. We'll help you determine the most engaging
content mix for your specific audience.
Q: How long should our newsletter be?
A: The optimal newsletter length is 300-500 words. This provides enough
content to deliver value while respecting your audience's time. Longer
content is better positioned as "read more" links to your website.
Q: Can we include images and videos in our newsletter?
A: Yes, visual elements significantly enhance engagement. Our template
will accommodate professional images and video thumbnails that link to
hosted videos, all optimised for email delivery.

A: We use SENDER (www.sender.net) for all newsletter campaigns due to

Q: Do we need to create our own SENDER account?
A: Yes, clients must have their own SENDER account. This ensures proper
ownership of data and compliance with privacy regulations. We provide
step-by-step setup guidance during onboarding.
Q: How is our email list managed?
A: Your subscriber list remains in your SENDER account. We implement
industry best practices for list management, including domain
verification and removal of invalid emails to ensure optimal
deliverability.
Q: How do we grow our subscriber list?
A: We implement website signup forms and recommend various
subscriber acquisition strategies, including lead magnets, social media
promotion, and website integration. List growth tactics are covered in
our quarterly performance reviews.
