# DerekZar.com Content Quality Analysis Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive content quality analysis that will be performed on derekzar.com once the WordPress API connection is established.

## Analysis Components

### 1. Lorem Ipsum & Placeholder Text Detection
The analysis will search for common placeholder text patterns including:
- "lorem ipsum" and related Latin text
- "placeholder", "dummy text", "sample text"
- "example content", "test content"
- "your content here", "insert text here"
- "coming soon", "under construction"
- Common Lorem Ipsum phrases like "dolor sit amet", "consectetur adipiscing"

Each finding will include:
- The exact placeholder text found
- Context (50 characters before and after)
- Position in the content
- Page ID and URL where found

### 2. H1 Semantic Structure Analysis
For each page, the analysis will check:
- **H1 Presence**: Does the page have at least one H1 tag?
- **H1 Count**: Are there multiple H1 tags? (SEO best practice is one H1 per page)
- **H1 Content Quality**:
  - Too short (less than 10 characters)
  - Too long (more than 70 characters)
  - Empty H1 tags
- **H1 Format**: Both HTML and Gutenberg block H1s are detected

### 3. SEO Title & Meta Description Analysis
The analysis examines:
- **SEO Title**:
  - Presence check
  - Length validation (ideal: 30-60 characters)
  - Quality assessment
- **Meta Description**:
  - Presence check
  - Length validation (ideal: 120-160 characters)
  - Quality assessment
- **Source Priority**: Checks Yoast SEO data first, falls back to WordPress defaults
